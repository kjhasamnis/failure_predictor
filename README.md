# failure_predictor
A Machine Learning Project created to predict the tool life of a machine shop tool. The tool life is calculated by two methods, an Artificial Neural Network and a Random Forest Regressor.

The MainPage.py is linked to InputPage.py and Theory.py via folder functions.

Therefore, the later two files should be stored in a folder inside the folder which is used as a directory to run MainPage.py
